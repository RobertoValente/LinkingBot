# 📝 About the Team
Our team already had other names and teammates but for RoboCup, our team was formed by: [Roberto](https://github.com/RobertoValente), [Vasco](https://github.com/VascoMagolo), Miguel, Samuel, Beatriz and our mentor was Fátima Pais. I will not mention everyone that helped in any way to we go and participate in RoboCup because it will take a long list but... 
<br><br>➜ **THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Without your help, nothing was possible. ❤️**
